\hoofdstuk{Main research}
This chapter will define the main research process. 

\paragraaf{Introduction}
%The goal of the main research is to find out if the chosen solution
The goal of the main research is to get a hands on with the chosen solution. Does it have the features Lunatech wants? Is it suitable for adoption by Lunatech? In other words: "\emph{Is Titanium viable for commerical useage?}". To answer this question we define the following hypothesis:
\begin{shadequote}
Titanium provides a commercially viable solution to the cross-platform development of mobile applications%\par\emph{W. de Kraker, 2012}
\end{shadequote}

%so what is viable?
\paragraaf{Defining viable}
To determine if a cross-platform mobile application development solution is considered viable for commercial usage a set of criteria has been provided by Lunatech.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Extensibility}\\
	Possibility to extend new features to the framework.
	\item \emph{Maturity}\\ 
	Maturity of framework.
	\item \emph{Documentation}\\
	Coverage, accessibility and up-to-dateness of the documentation.
\end{itemize}


Extensibility the possibility to extend Titanium with a new (custom) functionality. 
When the developer wants to implement a custom feature in the solution, the interfacing API should be easy to understand and use

The maturity is determined by checking for the following trustworthy elements: \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item Product Documentation,
\item Use of Established Mobile Standards,
\item Licenses,
\item Community activity,
\item Number of Commits and Bug Reports
\item Use of code management and versioning tools,
\item Requirements Management,
\item Availability and Use of a product roadmap.
\end{inparaenum}
This list was originally derived from the OpenSource Maturity Model\cite{Wikipedia2011} and has been augmented with elements fit to the specific mobile nature of the framework.


The documentation should be publicly accessible, cover all public methods in the most current version of the framework's API.

%it should have all the features implemented which we except to be there. 
%- steady stream of releases.
%- predictable development rate
%- how bugs are handled
%- community support
%
%Accessibility means the documentation is freely available online %and you don't have to look for it. 
%
%These issues come down to the question:
%is the developer spending more time fighting the framework, rather than developing his application?

%how do you want to prove this?
\paragraaf{Devised method}
In order to determine the commercial viability of the solution it is necessary to perform a case study which originates from a realistic scenario. During the case study the solution will be analyzed on its maturity and extensibility.  The extensibility will be tested by adding a missing feature to the use case scenario. The maturity of the framework will be tested by checking for the following trustworthy elements as defined above. Quality of the documentation will be judged on:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completeness\\
	Whether or not any missing parts are noticed during the development of the case study.
	\item Up-to-dateness\\
	Determined by the support of the latest version.
	\item Availability\\
	Determined by the location of the documentation and or IDE integration.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The main research process is divided between the case study and the analysis. Even though performed parallel, both serve different goals. The global structure looks as following:

\paragraaf{Case study}


\paragraaf{Extensibility}
It is possible to extend new functionality in Titanium. This is done at two levels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project based
	\item SDK based
\end{itemize}
The Project based extending of features is done by placing the module in the Titaniums installation directory. SDK based means that the module is built inline with the Titanium's source code, from there the module augments Titanium's SDK.  Extending Titanium's features at SDK level requires the entire framework to be rebuilt and compiled which can take up to 50 minutes. When a module is added on project base it only requires a restart from the framework, this process might take up to 2 minutes. Another downside is that a custom version of Titaniums SDK will have to be built and compiled for every new release. Therefore it is preferable to extend new functionality on project base.
