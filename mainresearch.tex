\hoofdstuk{Main research}
Work in progress.

This chapter will define the main research process. 

\paragraaf{Introduction}
%The goal of the main research is to find out if the chosen solution
The goal of the main research is to get a hands on with the chosen solution. Does it have the features Lunatech wants? Is it suitable for adoption by Lunatech? In other words: "\emph{Is Titanium viable for commerical useage?}"

%so what is viable?
\paragraaf{Defining viable}
To determine if a cross-platform mobile application development solution is considered viable for commercial usage a set of criteria has been provided by Lunatech.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Extensibility}\\
	How new features can be added to the existing framework.
	\item \emph{Maturity}\\ 
	Maturity of underlying code. \& implementation of features.
	\item \emph{Documentation}\\
	How extensive and accessible the documentation is.
\end{itemize}

Extensibility
When the developer wants to implement a custom feature in the solution, the interfacing API should be easy to understand and use

Maturity
The code underneath the API should be free from bugs' and programming errors.
Indications of this 
A immature code could have unpredictable issues.
Also: it should have all the features implemented which we except to be there. 
- steady stream of releases.
- predictable development rate
- how bugs are handled
- community support


Accessibility means the documentation is freely available online %and you don't have to look for it. 

These issues come down to the question:
is the developer spending more time fighting the framework, rather than developing his application?

%how do you want to prove this?
\paragraaf{Devised method}
In order to determine the viability of the solution it is vital to perform a case study which originates from a realistic scenario. During the case study the solution will be analyzed on its inner workings and its extensibility.

The extensibility will be tested by adding a missing feature to the use case scenario.

The maturity of the framework will be tested by:
- filling a bug report (if applicable) or alternatively posting an issue to the community



Quality of the documentation will be judged on:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completeness
	\item Up-to-dateness
	\item Orderliness
	\item Availability
\end{itemize}

%\paragraaf{Summary}
%To answer whether or not the chosen solution is commercially viable a case study will be performed during which the solution will be analyzed on provided criteria.
