\hoofdstuk{Main research}
This chapter will define the main research process. 

\paragraaf{Introduction}
%The goal of the main research is to find out if the chosen solution
The goal of the main research is to get a hands on with the chosen solution. Does it have the features Lunatech wants? Is it suitable for adoption by Lunatech? In other words: "\emph{Is Titanium viable for commerical useage?}"

%so what is viable?
\paragraaf{Defining viable}
To determine if a cross-platform mobile application development solution is considered viable for commercial usage a set of criteria has been provided by Lunatech.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Extensibility}\\
	Possibility to extend new features to the framework.
	\item \emph{Maturity}\\ 
	Maturity of framework.
	\item \emph{Documentation}\\
	Coverage, accessibility and up-to-dateness of the documentation.
\end{itemize}


Extensibility the possibility to extend Titanium with a new (custom) functionality. 
When the developer wants to implement a custom feature in the solution, the interfacing API should be easy to understand and use

The maturity is determined by checking for the following trustworthy elements: \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
\item Product Documentation,
\item Use of Established Mobile Standards,
\item Licenses,
\item Community activity,
\item Number of Commits and Bug Reports
\item Use of code management and versioning tools,
\item Requirements Management,
\item Availability and Use of a product roadmap.
\end{inparaenum}
This list was originally derived from the OpenSource Maturity Model\cite{Wikipedia2011} and has been augmented with elements fit to the specific mobile nature of the framework.


The documentation should be publicly accessible, cover all public methods in the most current version of the frameworks' API.

%it should have all the features implemented which we except to be there. 
%- steady stream of releases.
%- predictable development rate
%- how bugs are handled
%- community support
%
%Accessibility means the documentation is freely available online %and you don't have to look for it. 
%
%These issues come down to the question:
%is the developer spending more time fighting the framework, rather than developing his application?

%how do you want to prove this?
\paragraaf{Devised method}
In order to determine the viability of the solution it is vital to perform a case study which originates from a realistic scenario. During the case study the solution will be analyzed on its inner workings and its extensibility.

The extensibility will be tested by adding a missing feature to the use case scenario.

The maturity of the framework will be tested by:
- filling a bug report (if applicable) or alternatively posting an issue to the community



Quality of the documentation will be judged on:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Completeness
	\item Up-to-dateness
	\item Orderliness
	\item Availability
	\item Awesomeness
\end{itemize}

%\paragraaf{Summary}
%To answer whether or not the chosen solution is commercially viable a case study will be performed during which the solution will be analyzed on provided criteria.

\hoofdstuk{Results}


\paragraaf{Extensibility}
It is possible to extend new functionality in Titanium. This is done at 2 levels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project based
	\item SDK based
\end{itemize}
The Project based extending of features is done by placing the module in the Titaniums installation directory. SDK based means that the module is built inline with the Titaniums' source code, from there the module augments Titaniums SDK.  Extending Titaniums features at SDK level requires the entire framework to be rebuilt and compiled it which can take up to 50 minutes. When a module is added on project base it only requires a restart from the framework, this process might take up to 2 minutes. Another downside is that a custom version of Titaniums SDK will have to be built and compiled for every new release. Therefore it is preferable to extend new functionality on project base.
