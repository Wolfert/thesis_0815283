%The goal of the main research is to get a hands on with the chosen solution. Does it have the features Lunatech wants? Is it suitable for adoption by Lunatech? In other words: "\emph{Is Titanium viable for commerical useage?}".

%A solution to the cross-platform paradigm would have to meet a specific set of criteria.

The preliminary research confirmed that there is an existing solution as defined by Lunatech's criteria. In order to determine if this solution is suitable for adoption by Lunatech it is necessary to determine the its viability.
Henceforth primary goal of the main research is to confirm the following hypothesis:
\begin{shadequote}
Titanium provides a viable solution to the cross-platform development of mobile applications%\par\emph{W. de Kraker, 2012}
\end{shadequote}

\noindent The secondary goal of the main research is to analyze how Titanium works and why it provides the desired native \emph{look-and-feel}. The results of this will add to the answer of the main research question.


%Based on the results of the preliminary research was determined that there is an existing solution as defined by Lunatech's criteria. In conclusion of this result


%As discussed in the \emph{Introduction} chapter, Lunatech has stated that it would like to know how to make use of the look-and-feel from native apps with the cross-platform support of web apps. During the preliminary research was determined that there is an existing solution as defined by Lunatech's criteria. Based on this result the following hypothesis has been defined:
%\begin{shadequote}
%Titanium provides a commercially viable solution to the cross-platform development of mobile applications%\par\emph{W. de Kraker, 2012}
%\end{shadequote}





%Therefor the goal of the main research is to define


%so what is viable?
\subparagraaf{Defining viable}
To determine if a cross-platform mobile application development solution is considered viable for usage a set of criteria has been provided by Lunatech.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Extensibility}\\
	The possibility to extend new features to the framework.
	\item \emph{Maturity}\\ 
	Maturity of framework.
	\item \emph{Documentation}\\
	Coverage, accessibility and up-to-dateness of the documentation.
%	\item \emph{Underlying technique}\\
%	Should provide truly native user interface	
\end{itemize}


{\bf Extensibility} is the possibility to extend Titanium with a new (custom) functionality. 
When the developer wants to implement a custom feature in the solution, the interfacing API should be easy to understand and use

The {\bf maturity} is determined by checking for predefined \emph{trustworthy elements} which are derived from the OpenSource Maturity Model\cite{Wikipedia2011}. The OSMM provides a formal methodology which utilizes a standardized analytical scheme for evaluating the maturity of an open source product. For this research the OSMM scheme has been augmented with elements fit to the specific mobile nature of the framework.

The {\bf documentation} should be publicly accessible, cover all public methods in the most current version of the framework's API.

%it should have all the features implemented which we except to be there. 
%- steady stream of releases.
%- predictable development rate
%- how bugs are handled
%- community support
%
%Accessibility means the documentation is freely available online %and you don't have to look for it. 
%
%These issues come down to the question:
%is the developer spending more time fighting the framework, rather than developing his application?

%how do you want to prove this?
\paragraaf{Method}
In order to determine the viability of the solution it is necessary to perform a case study which originates from a realistic scenario. During the case study the solution will be analyzed on its inner workings. 

The extensibility will be tested by adding a custom or missing feature to the case study application. The following points will be evaluated:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
  \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item Requirements for extending a custom feature
	\item Availability of third party extensions
\end{itemize}

\noindent The maturity of the framework will be assessed using an augmented version OpenSource Maturity Model assessment scheme. This scheme consists of a set predefined trustworthy elements:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
  \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
\item Product Documentation,
\item Use of Established Mobile Standards,
\item Licenses,
\item Community activity,
\item Number of Commits and Bug Reports
\item Use of code management and versioning tools,
\item Requirements Management,
\item Availability and Use of a product roadmap.
\end{itemize} 
%TODO OSSM twe's verklaren

\noindent Quality of the documentation will be judged on:
\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}
  \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
	\item Completeness\\
	Whether or not any missing parts are noticed during the development of the case study.
	\item Up-to-dateness\\
	Determined by the support of the latest version.
	\item Availability\\
	Determined by the location of the documentation and or IDE integration.
\end{itemize}

\paragraaf{Results}
This paragraph summarizes the results of the main research.

\subparagraaf{Extensibility}
It is possible to extend new functionality in Titanium. This is done at two levels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project based
	\item SDK based
\end{itemize}
The Project based extending of features is done by placing the module in the Titaniums installation directory. SDK based means that the module is built inline with the Titanium's source code, from there the module augments Titanium's SDK.  Extending Titanium's features at SDK level requires the entire framework to be rebuilt and compiled which can take up to 50 minutes. When a module is added on project base it only requires a restart from the framework, this process might take up to 2 minutes. Another downside is that a custom version of Titaniums SDK will have to be built and compiled for every new release. Therefore it is preferable to extend new functionality on project base.

\subparagraaf{Maturity}
The following diagram is based on observations done during the analysis.

\end{tabel}


\subparagraaf{Documentation}
During the case study the documentation of Titanium was used daily for a period of 8 weeks. The following observations were made: The documentation is located at a central web resource and in addition has been integrated in Titanium's IDE. All methods and functions which were needed during the development of the case study were found in the documentation. During the development of the case study a new version of Titanium was release, the documentation was update consequently. Each described function has a simple overview of which platforms it supports and in which SDK version it is included. As a result of these observations the following score's are met:
