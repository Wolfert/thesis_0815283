%The fragmented mobile landscape presents considerable challenges around application development. The growing number of OSs and mix of devices, form factors and standards have turned native application development into a cost-prohibitive strategy, resulting in a growing market of cross-platform solutions and mobile development tools.

%But many solutions hold significant shortcomings. Be it proprietary interpreters, esoteric coding languages, pre-packaged apps, or limiting form-based IDEs, mobile developers are facing a tradeoff between cost and time to market and app capabilities.

Nowadays mobile devices are vastly integrated into modern society. They bring us one step closer to satisfy our ever growing need to have information available anytime, anywhere. To help gain access to information on mobile devices we use mobile applications, so called \emph{apps}. 

However, the fragmented nature of today's mobile ecosystem poses a challenge for developers to apps which are suitable to run on all mobile devices, since there is no de facto standard in \emph{cross-platform} app development.

Currently there are several solutions available to solve the cross-platform paradigm.

Lunatech, having expressed its interest in mobile app development, would like to know which of these solutions, \emph{if any}, suits Lunatechs needs. A study has been setup in order to resolve this question. The results of which are laid out in this thesis.
