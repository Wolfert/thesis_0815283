%The fragmented mobile landscape presents considerable challenges around application development. The growing number of OSs and mix of devices, form factors and standards have turned native application development into a cost-prohibitive strategy, resulting in a growing market of cross-platform solutions and mobile development tools.

%But many solutions hold significant shortcomings. Be it proprietary interpreters, esoteric coding languages, pre-packaged apps, or limiting form-based IDEs, mobile developers are facing a tradeoff between cost and time to market and app capabilities.

Nowadays mobile devices are vastly integrated into modern society. They bring us one step closer to satisfy our ever growing need to have information available anytime, anywhere. To help gain access to information on mobile devices we use so called \emph{apps}. 

However the fragmented nature of today's mobile ecosystem poses a challenge for mobile developers to develop apps which are suitable to run on all mobile devices \emph{(cross-platform}, since there is no de facto standard.

Currently there are several cross-platform mobile application development frameworks which offer a solution to this problem. 

Lunatech having expressed its interest in mobile app development, would like to know which of these framework, \emph{if any}, suits Lunatechs needs best. A research has been setup in order to resolve this question, its result is layed out in this thesis.
