\hoofdstuk{Defining native}
\paragraaf{Intoduction}
The following chapter will define the \emph{native look-and-feel}.

\paragraaf{Native mobile applications}
A native application is by definition an application inherent to the platform it was build for using techniques proprietary to the platform. For example, an iOS application is native when written in Objective-C and an Android app is written in Java.  Native apps are typically fast can can acces the devices n

\subparagraaf{The native look-and-feel}
When written in the native framework for a platform an mobile application receives acces to the available public libraries of the platform. These libraries include the UIKit\emph{(on iOS)} which provides the developer with a pre fabricated set of user interface components. These can be seen as the buildingblocks for the graphical userinterface on that platform. When used, the general style of the mobile application gains homogeneity to the overal user interface design of the platforms operating system. This gives an application its native look, which in turn participates to the native feel.

%with a feeling of recognition when using the application, userinterface elements work as they expected based upon experience with using the operating system.

The native feel of a mobile application can be defined as the in the speed which the userinterface elements, the responsiveness of userinterface elements to touch events, and finally smoothness of the animation in which the userinterface elements are moved.
A native mobile application has the advantage to hardware acceleration. This means its code has been precompiled and directly executed by the device CPU. As a result of this the userinterface feels smooth.
 	

\paragraaf{Alternative mobile application types}
\subparagraaf{Web applications}
A mobile web application is an application developed with web technologies as Javascript and HTML5 with CSS3. It is in fact nothing more than a website designed to fit on mobile devices, often they resemble the style of a native app rather than a traditional website. Often these application are build with a Javascript library to add support for scrolling and handling touch events. These touch events are handled via widgets, userinterface elements which provide the user with components composed similair to the native components. Examples of these libraries include jQtouch, SenchaTouch.


\subparagraaf{Hybrid applications}
A hybrid application in mobile development refers to an application which use a native \emph{shell} to wrap a web app. There are generally two forms of native shells,  the first is  webview and second a native framework which exposes a javascript API to provide the web app access to otherwise native API's.

\subparagraaf{Webviewbased hybrid applications}
A webviewbased hybrid app is nothing more as a webbased mobile application wrapped in a webview. A webview is a view or element which is acts like a browser would, e.g. it is able to render HTML and run javascript.  It is readily available in the native libraries. The advantage of a webviewbased hybrid app over an normal web app is that it can be published via the devices native app publishing platforms. e.g. a webviewbased hybrid app targetted for the iPhone can be placed in the Apple appstore. 

Worklight is an example of a framework which can be used to develop webviewbased hybrid applications.

\subparagraaf{Mixed hybrid applications}
A Mixed based hybrid app is a webviewbased app build upon a framework which provides a Javascript API to allow the app access to otherwise native API's. The framework is written in the platforms native programming language, this provides the possibility to access the native API, such as reading contact list, composing of SMSes, full access to the location API, etc.

PhoneGap is an example of a framework which can be used to develop mixed hybrid applications.

\paragraaf{Comparison}
Web apps are quick and cheap to develop. Written entirely in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Executed by the mobile
browser and therefore cross - platform by default, but less powerful than native apps.
 
Hybrid Apps (Web), the app's source code consists of web code executed within a native wrapper that is provided by a framework.
 
Hybrid Apps (Mix), the developer augments the web code with a Javascript API to create unique features and
access native APIs that are not yet available via the browser, such as AR, NFC and others.
 
Native App are platform-specific. Requires unique expertise and knowledge. Pricey and time consuming to develop but
 delivers the highest user experience of all approaches.

\hoofdstuk{Exsisting solutions to Cross-platform Mobile Application Development}
\paragraaf{Introduction}
In todays industry exist several cross-platform mobile application development frameworks which offer a solution to cross-platform problem. All of these frameworks provide a custom solution of crossing the bride between platforms. In order determine which one should be adopted by Lunatech for mobile development the following criteria have been set up for comparisson:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Platform support}\\
Which platforms and their versions are supported by the framework.
\item \emph{Native UI support}\\
Whether or not native userinterface elements are supported as per supported platform.
\item \emph{Programming language}\\
Which programming language is used to develop using the framework.
\item \emph{IDE}\\
Which IDE is used to develop using the framework.
\item \emph{Lisence type}\\
Which lisence type is available.
\item \emph{Application type}\\
Which type of mobile application is produced using this framework.
\end{itemize}

The cross-platform criterium is based on Lunatechs requirement to build mobile applications for the operating systems have have at least a 10 percent marketshare in the earopean continent. Second after that comes the support for native userinterface elements. Togother these criteria form the essense of the main research question: "\emph{How to develop a cross-platform mobile application while retaining the native look-and-feel?}"
The remaining criteria are of secondary importance, they will provide more detail means to provide frameworks which offer native UI support.

The following solutions have been choosen for review: \emph{Titanium, Rhodes, Worklight and MoSync}. These are derived from the list "Existing solutions" %todo.


\paragraaf{Appcelerator Titanium}
Appceleator Titanium is an commericially supported opensource platform for developing cross-platform mobile applications. It was introduced by Appcelerator Inc. in December 2008. Build upon the EclipseIDE Titanium offers a Javascript API to native mapper classes which allow the developer to generate truely native cross-platform mobile applications.

\paragraaf{Rhodes}
Rhodes is an open source Ruby-based framework to build native apps for all major smartphone operating systems (iPhone, Android, RIM, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone 7). These are true native device applications (not mobile web apps) which work with synchronized local data and take advantage of device capabilities such as GPS, PIM contacts and calendar, camera, native mapping, push, barcode, signature capture, Bluetooth and Near Field Communications (NFC)

\paragraaf{Worklight}
Worklight Studio is an eclipse based IDE for the cross-platform development of mobile apps. Worklight Studio was introduced in 200x by Worklight Inc. In early 2012 Worklight Inc. became an IBM company. Worklight Studio offers mobile development trough the use of webtechnologies such as HTML5, and Javascript.

\paragraaf{MoSync}
The MoSync mobile SDK offers cross-platform development trough the use of webtechnologie or C/C++.
