\noindent I would like to thank my first supervisor, Youri Tjang, for his efforts in coaching and the many good advices. The advices given by Youri have had a profound effect on the structure of my thesis.

As to my mentor at Lunatech Research, I would like to thank Sietse de Kaper, for his patience and professionalism. His professionalism helped me to keep the research focus on the right track and not to dwell on details.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my second supervisor, Hossein Chamani, for having faith in me during the project. The feedback provided by Hossein inspired me to continually look for order, system and interrelationships.
