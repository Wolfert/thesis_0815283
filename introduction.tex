\paragraaf{Problem statement}

To meet their customer's demands Lunatech needs to develop cross-platform mobile applications. Currently these applications are developed using web technologies such as HTML and Javascript. A mobile application developed in this manner is referred to as web app because it runs in a browser based environment and is often hosted at a web server rather than downloaded to the device itself.

The problem with web apps is that they lack in user experience. This is mainly due to the browsers' sandbox environment in which the app runs. Every platform has its own set of recognizable user interface elements, but these cannot be accessed from within the browser environment. To overcome this problem web app developers build the user interface in HTML.  As a result of this the app does not feel native to the user because its style does not match the style of the platform. Web app developers often try to mimic the native look-and-feel, but a web app does not live up to the level of user experience which a native app offers.

The direct alternative to web apps are native apps, native apps are written using technologies proprietary to each platform, hence the term \emph{native}. What these applications lack in terms of cross-platform support they make up in terms of user experience.  A native app has access to all the platforms libraries and can rely on user interface elements provided through these libraries.

Lunatech would like to know how to make use of the look-and-feel from native apps with the cross-platform support of web apps.

\paragraaf{Research questions}

Main research question:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{How to develop a cross-platform mobile application while retaining the native look-and-feel?}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Sub research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Which solutions to cross-platform mobile application development currently exist?}
\item \emph{Which of these solutions offer the defined native look-and-feel?}
\item \emph{Are these solutions viable for commerical useage?}
\item \emph{Is it viable to implement a custom solution to cross-platform mobile application development?}
\end{itemize}

\paragraaf{Research method}

This paragraph will describe the method used during the research.\\

First the context of the main research question needs to be determined. This is done by defining the concepts \emph{native look-and-feel} and \emph{cross-platform}. The \emph{native look-and-feel} is defined by the a set of criteria related to the user experience while \emph{cross-platform} is defined as the scope of which platforms should be targeted. This is particularly important because the context and definition of these concepts will form the basic requirements on which this research will focus.

Once the context of the main research question has been defined it is needed to research which solutions fit within its scope. During a preliminary research a market survey will have to be performed in order to determine which solutions to cross-platform app development are available on today's market. Each found solution will be given a closer look and categorized based on requirements provided by Lunatech. Once the categorization is complete the solutions will be filtered based on how far the requirements have been met.

A comparison test will be performed in order to determine which solution is potentially viable for use by Lunatech. This test will consist of a short analysis per solution based on Lunatech's criteria, and a practical part where a benchmark application will be built. The results will be compared and the solution which offers the most complete set of features will be deemed potentially viable for use by Lunatech. At this point a decision has to be made whether to continue with the potentially viable existing solution or research a custom solution. If no existing solution meets the criteria set by Lunatech the main research will focus on implementing a custom solution.

To determine if the chosen solution is viable for commercial use by Lunatech a case study will be performed based on a realistic scenario Lunatech might encounter. During this case study the solution will be analyzed and evaluated.

The results of the case study and the analysis will contribute to answering the main research question. In addition to answering the main research question a recommendation will be given to Lunatech regarding the possible adaptation of the solution for commercial usage.
